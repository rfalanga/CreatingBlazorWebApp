# CreatingBlazorWebApp

I am following along with Rob Garner's Blazor tutorial. This is, I think, the first coding of a Blazor app. He did this 3 months ago, so about September 2024.

Following Rob's example, this is a .NET 8 app.

At this point this is the end of the Creating a Blazor Web App tutorial. It's only 7 minutes long.
