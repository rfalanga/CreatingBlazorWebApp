This is a longer tutorial, over 43  minutes. 

Note: At this point the email sender (IEmailSender) is not yet implemented. This is because it is a template and having the template do everything isn't possible, so if you're going to use email, then this has to be implemented.

I got confused as to the name of the 43 minute tutorial. It is "Structure of a Blazor Web App."
