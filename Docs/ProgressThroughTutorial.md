This is a longer tutorial, over 43  minutes. 

Note: At this point the email sender (IEmailSender) is not yet implemented. This is because it is a template and having the template do everything isn't possible, so if you're going to use email, then this has to be implemented.

At the end of my time going through this tutorial, I got to 12 minutes into the tutorial.
